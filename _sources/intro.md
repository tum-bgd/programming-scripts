# About this Repository

<a href="programming.pdf">Download as PDF</A>

This repository is an Open Educational Resource (OER) capturing various topics on computation both for students from aerospace and geodesy. Of course, all content appearing on this page in the future is going to be something we believe being of high importance for **both** geodesy and aerospace. But maybe not at the same time during study or maybe not for every focus area inside these sciences. Hence, students and self-learners are asked to always critically review which parts are of most value for them.

In order to clarify the aspects really relevant to the lecture audiences and especially to possible
examinations, we prepare two tables of contents for both lectures.


# Principles of Programming (2022)
Principles of Programming is a one-semester master course building on profound knowledge of object-oriented design, programming in Java, and geospatial data in all its forms by adding aspects of software engineering, the high-performance language C++ (in its modern form) and Python.

# Computational Foundations (2022)
Computational Foundations is a two-semester course in the aerospace bachelor and aims at laying out fundamentals of working with computers including aspects from theoretical computer science, computer engineering, and programming selected for their relevance in aerospace engineering.
